# OLA1_systems_integration

## Organise a technology stack for the assignment– whatever the problem is you need certain technologies to solve it – this one needs a version control platform, text editing and desk (online research). For a better outcome a development stack too. Agree as a group a project management style and approach.

- Text editing technology: LateX / Overleaf. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/68b171348c25df3d90ec95ff)
- Referencing tool: Zotero.
- Version control platform: Github.
- Desk / project management: Miro. [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJO1kyvA=/)

## Explore current thinking (blogs, online articles, videos etc) about Enterprise Integration. There are some starter ideas in the folder for extra material. By Enterprise Integration I mean distributed scalable applications with data storage that rely on diLerent ‘services’ or modules talking to each other. This means monolithic applications as well as microservices.

## Produce a report (8 sides max) and a short video presentation (5 minutes) demonstrating your findings. The result should be a report you can use to prepare for the exam (What is Enterprise Integration, what diagramming standards are there, what does the code for an integration pattern such as ‘pipes and filters’ look like? What security concerns are dealt with at the EA level?)

## Upload your report and associated documentation to your favourite version control environment. Email me the link and the names of everyone who contributed to the research project or upload the link to the OLA1 Upload Folder on Moodle. I will track study points using a spreadsheet so please make the group member names obvious!

## Including working examples of integration patterns will be useful to you in the future for the exam project so make sure to do that.
